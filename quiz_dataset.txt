Which transactions are captured if you ADD EXTRACT with BEGIN NOW at 1:00 PM, START EXTRACT at 2:00 PM?#\n\na) Transactions that started at or after 1:00 PM\n\nb) Transactions that started before 1:00 PM and committed after 2:00 PM\n\nc) Only transactions that started at or after 2:00 PM\n\nd) Only transactions that started before 1:00 PM and committed after 1:00 PM#a
You must synchronize the starting point for Replicat with the restore point of the target database. How should you accomplish this?#\n\na) Use the command option ATCSN.\n\nb) Use the command option RESUME.\n\nc) Use the command option UNTIL CANCEL.\n\nd) Use the command option AFTERCSN.#d
